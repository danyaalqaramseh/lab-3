# Things we must be aware if we make a website :


## PROCESS & Design

- **It's important to understand who your target audience
  is, why they would come to your site, what information
  they want to find and when they are likely to return.**

- **Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.**

- **Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
  will need to go on each page.**

- **Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
  visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.**
- **You can differentiate between pieces of information
  using size, color, and style.**
- **You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
  the information you present.**


## About layouting HTML

*The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.*

- *The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).*
- *Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.*
- *To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google*
